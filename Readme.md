# Introduction
Add a picture in markdown document is difficult.

This project is used to simplify these process.
It's version 1.0. It contains function screen shot in your windows, show the screen capture, name it, upload to your git repositories, and set this capture's in your clipboard, you just need to paste in your markdown document.

So now just need three steps to add picture in your markdown.

Step 1. Open this tool, click on the 'Screen Shot' button.

# Predefine
## Img Repository initialization
As this tool is not for git management purpose, you need to predefine your img repository.
You can follow steps below.
> cd LOCAL_FILE_PATH
> git init
> git pull GIT_REMOTE_URL
> git remote add origin GIT_REMOTE_URL
> git push --set-upstream master master

## Tool Predefined
For now 'Settings' is not avaiable, all setting needs to define in the 'app.properties' file.
As below shown.
